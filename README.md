# logger

This app was designed to be a simple logging tool for a small IT team. You can log infrastructure changes
in a central location and notify team members via email or sms. I'm most proud of the animations as you 
tab between fields and after you submit the log.

The PHP version was my first iteration and the NodeJS version is my effort to learn Express. Originally I
wanted to do Angular along with Express, but I found that writing the log search feature in my own 
Javascript was more fun. :)
